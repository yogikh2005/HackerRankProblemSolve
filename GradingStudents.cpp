/*
HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

Every student receives a  in the inclusive range from  to .
Any  less than  is a failing grade.
Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's  according to these rules:

If the difference between the  and the next multiple of  is less than , round  up to the next multiple of .
If the value of  is less than , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.
Examples

 round to  (85 - 84 is less than 3)
 do not round (result is less than 38)
 do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)
Given the initial value of  for each of Sam's  students, write code to automate the rounding process.

Function Description

Complete the function  with the following parameter(s):

: the grades before rounding
Returns

: the grades after rounding
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , the number of students.
Each line  of the  subsequent lines contains a single integer, .

Student  received a , and the next multiple of  from  is . Since , the student's grade is rounded to .
Student  received a , and the next multiple of  from  is . Since , the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is .
Student  received a , and the next multiple of  from  is . Since , the student's grade will be rounded to .
Student  received a grade below , so the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is .
